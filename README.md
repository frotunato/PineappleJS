# PineappleJS

The world first Minecraft preprocessor, designed to abstract the mapmaking logic. 

Through a web editor using a C like syntax, you can define complex in-game actions. It outputs a NBT file that can be easily injected onto an existing map. The code is compiled to an in-game 64x64 square, up to 128 blocks high. The cube is designed to be contained in one single chunk, further improving performance.
